Null hypothesis: p2 - p1 ³ delta (inferior), where:

Estimated sample size for two-sample comparison of proportions (non-inferiority)

Null hypothesis: p2 - p1 ³ delta (inferior), where:
                               pi (entered in command) is the overall proportion of participants
                               expected to experience the outcome if the treatments
                               are non-inferior, and delta is the smallest change in
                               proportions between groups (p2 - p1) which would still
                               be clinically important.

Alternative hypothesis: p2 - p1 < delta (non-inferior)

Note: a non-inferiority analysis is one-sided.

Assumptions:
         power = 0.7000
         alpha = 0.0250 (one-sided)
            pi = 0.3000
